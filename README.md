# Carla

Carla is an open source simulator for autnomous Driving with vast amount of capabilities

I used a DQN framework from somewhere I cannot remember and employed it in Carla to establish a API like engagemnet between carla and my script.

I used the DQNtrainer and combined it with numerical modelling techniques to shorten the time for calculations.
